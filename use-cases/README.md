####Purpose
The purpose of this online documentation is to present a definition of the use cases of Sulu 2.0. It contains the major use cases of the system and is intended for project leaders, developers and users.

####Structure
This documentation includes the use cases (UCxxx Use Case Name) consolidated in use case packages (Pxxx Use Case Package Name). In order to ensure a better overview use cases are organized in 9 main use case packages reflecting the 9 system processes. The following schema shows the use case model of Sulu 2.0:

Fig. Use Case Model

The [system requirements] (https://github.com/massiveart/sulu-docs/tree/master/system-requirements/) are linked to the use cases if necessary. Associated [system requirements](https://github.com/massiveart/sulu-docs/tree/master/system-requirements/), uses cases and [detail specifications](https://github.com/massiveart/sulu-docs/tree/master/detail-specification/) can be determined through the continuous system process number (eg. system process "300 Portals" is similar to use case package "P300").
