####Description
The AdminPool-Service holds all Admin-classes provided by other bundles. These Admin-classes are derived from a abstract Admin-class provided by the SuluAdminBundle. The concrete Admin-classes are defined as services with a specific tag ("sulu.admin"). This is needed because a CompilerPass called by the SuluAdminBundle-class uses this tag for registering the Admin-classes in the AdminPool-Service.

The Admin-classes contains the required information for displaying the navigation in SULU.
