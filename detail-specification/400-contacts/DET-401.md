####Description
#####General
This diagram is splitted in the contacts and security part, where the tables are prefixed with `co_` resp. `se_`. Every base table (means that a table is not only existing for serving another table with data) contains some fields for specifying creation (`idContactsCreator` for the user and `created` for the time) and the last change (`idContactsChanger` for the user and `changed` for the time).

Structures with 1:n relations, which can be shared between accounts and contacts (e.g. emails, phones, notes, ...) are separated in own tables. The accounts- or contacts-table establishes the connection to these structures with another resolution-table (e.g. `co_contact_emails`, `co_account_emails`, `co_contact_phones`, ...). The advantage of this approach is that there will only be one `Email`-, `Phone`- and `Note`-Entity in the source code, instead of an `AccountEmail`, `ContactEmail` and so on, which also results in a better maintainability.
