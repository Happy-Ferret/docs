####Database Diagram

![Contacts database diagram](https://raw.github.com/massiveart/sulu-docs/master/detail-specification/images/db/contacts.png)

####Description
#####General
This diagram is splitted in the contacts and security part, where the tables are prefixed with `co_` resp. `se_`. Every base table (means that a table is not only existing for serving another table with data) contains some fields for specifying creation (`idContactsCreator` for the user and `created` for the time) and the last change (`idContactsChanger` for the user and `changed` for the time). This fields will be set to null when the contact is deleted.

Structures with 1:n relations, which can be shared between accounts and contacts (e.g. emails, phones, notes, ...) are separated in own tables. The accounts- or contacts-table establishes the connection to these structures with another resolution-table (e.g. `co_contact_emails`, `co_account_emails`, `co_contact_phones`, ...). The advantage of this approach is that there will only be one `Email`-, `Phone`- and `Note`-Entity in the source code, instead of an `AccountEmail`, `ContactEmail` and so on, which also results in a better maintainability. When an Account or Contact will be deleted the Controller will remove the email/phone/address to, if they has no other owner.

Types and statuses are usually extracted in own tables, which almost everytime consist of an id and a name.

#####Contacts
The main table of this bundle is the `co_contacts`-table, which contains all the contacts of the system. This includes newsletter subscribers, business contacts and Sulu users as well. That's why the `username`- and `password`-fields are optional. It also contains some fields containing more information about the user, like his/her name, title or a foreign-key to the company (in the database called `account`) the user is working for.

Furthermore the user has relations to emails, phones, notes and addresses resolved liked described in the General-section of this document.

#####Accounts
An account is quite similiar to a contact, but it is representing a company instead of a single person. Although it is quite similiar it is stored in its own table, because of query optimizations. We use the nested set model for building a tree of companies (which is also supported by some doctrine extensions). 

Besides its standard fields it also stores relations to emails, phones, notes, addresses and urls (an abstraction for company websites with a type like website, blog, intranet, different portals, ...) as described in the General-section of this document.

#####Light CRM Approach
In the database model are also some CRM functionalities built in. A contact has several activities, which can be passive or active. An active activity is entered in the system by a Sulu user (e.g. a telephone conversation or a meeting). Passive activities are events triggered by Sulu, like an ingoing order, a new subscription for a newsletter or just a simple login. It always contains some timestamps and a name for the activity. The optional fields are reserverd for priorities, reminders or a due date, which obviously make only sense for an active activity.

#####Permissions
Every Sulu user (which is just a special type of contact) can have some roles and groups.

Roles define the permissions for a specific security context. These contexts are offered by different registered bundles in the Sulu system, and because of that the contexts are linked in the database as simple text-based keys. This information is stored in the `se_role`-table, additionally with the system which offers this security context. A system can also be described as a module in Sulu, like Sulu itself, a shop or a community.
The permission are stored as a bit field in a numeric data type. This presentation is also used in the unix file systems. It is also supported by the Symfony Security Bundle, which makes it very easy to use this component.

Groups are stored in the `se_groups`-table, and they are simply a combination of some roles (which is resolved in the `se_group_roles`-table). They offer also the possibility to build a permission tree, which is again represented as a nested set (just like the accounts). On this way you can combine different permissions.

A Sulu user can be in several roles and several groups (stored in the tables `se_contact_roles`and `se_contact_groups`, and the combination of the resulting roles resp. permissions is the set of allowed operations for this specific user.
