####Description
#####General
This diagram is splitted in the contacts and security part, where the tables are prefixed with `co_` resp. `se_`. Every base table (means that a table is not only existing for serving another table with data) contains some fields for specifying creation (`idContactsCreator` for the user and `created` for the time) and the last change (`idContactsChanger` for the user and `changed` for the time).

Structures with 1:n relations, which can be shared between accounts and contacts (e.g. emails, phones, notes, ...) are separated in own tables. The accounts- or contacts-table establishes the connection to these structures with another resolution-table (e.g. `co_contact_emails`, `co_account_emails`, `co_contact_phones`, ...). The advantage of this approach is that there will only be one `Email`-, `Phone`- and `Note`-Entity in the source code, instead of an `AccountEmail`, `ContactEmail` and so on, which also results in a better maintainability.

Types and statuses are usually extracted in own tables, which almost everytime consist of an id and a name.

#####Contacts
The main table of this bundle is the `co_contacts`-table, which contains all the contacts of the system. This includes newsletter subscribers, business contacts and Sulu users as well. That's why the `username`- and `password`-fields are optional. It also contains some fields containing more information about the user, like his/her name, title or a foreign-key to the company (in the database called `account`) the user is working for.

Furthermore the user has relations to emails, phones, notes and addresses resolved liked described in the General-section of this document.
