####Purpose
The purpose of this online documentation is to present a definition of the system requirements of Sulu 2.0. It will explain the features of the system and the constraints under which it must operate. This documentation is intended for the project leaders and developers of the system.

####Structure
In order to ensure a better overview the system requirements are subdivided into 9 system processes. The following schema shows a model of the relevant system processes of Sulu 2.0:

Fig. System Processes

####Rating System
Three level rating system:
* mandatory (“The system shall provide…")
* desirable (“The system should enable…" or "The system may have…") 
* optional (code-marked: [optional])

The mandatory requirements cannot be sacrificed, desirable requirements are important but could be sacrificed if necessary to meet schedule or budgetary concerns. Optional requirements are ones which may not be developed (“nice to haves”).

Requirements which are necessary for the planned alpha release are marked with an ![Alpha](https://raw.github.com/massiveart/sulu-docs/master/system-requirements/images/alpha.png).

####Functional and Nonfunctional Requirements
* Functional requirements [FR-xxxx] are generally written from a bird’s-eye viewpoint and describe system capabilities users expect for solving a specific problem.

* Nonfunctional requirements [NFR-xxxx] are boundary conditions or externalities to the system under construction which will effect the performance envelope or capabilities of the system once it is in operation.
