####FR-1301 IP to Location
The IP-to-location function automatically forwards the user to the language version of his country of origin. Sulu has to support an IP-to-location service, implemented as a plugin. The mapping of the country-specific IP-address ranges to the different languages can be done by system engineers. A user interface for content managers has do be planned for later versions.  

####FR-1302 Language fall back
A user must be able to choose a different language for a page within the specific language version of a portal. All pages within a content node has to be viewable as list showing all available and assigned languages. The language fall back function has to be accessible also via the list view. 

####FR-1303 Copying a language version
An existing page in a certain language can be a valuable input for the translation into another language. Therefore the user copies a specific page and translates the content. Translated pages can be stored anywhere in the same or in a different portal. The list view allows to copy and save whole nodes or a selection of pages at once.
