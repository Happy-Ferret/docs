##System Specification
####Purpose
The purpose of this online documentation is to present a definition of the system specification of Sulu 2.0. It contains the major use cases of the system and the detail specification documents. This documentation is intended for the project leaders and developers of the system.

####Scope of Project
Sulu 2.0 will be a Content Management Framework (CMF) based on Open Source - technologies replacing the current Content Management System ZOOLU. This system will be optimized for middle and large sized enterprises with multinational organizations, worldwide markets and products.

By maximizing work efficiency of content management processes the system will meet the content manager´s needs while remaining easy to understand and use. More specifically, this system is designed to allow a content manager to manage multi-portals in multi-languages within complex product structures.

####Structure
This documentation includes 
* use cases (UCxxx Use Case Name) consolidated in use case packages (Pxxx Use Case Package Name)
* detail specification documents (DETxxx refered to system processes

The [system requirements] (https://github.com/massiveart/sulu-docs/tree/master/system-requirements/) are linked to use cases and detail specification documents if necessary. Associated system requirements, uses cases and detail specifications can be determined through the continuous system process number. The use case packages are using the system process number as prefix (eg. system process "300 Portals" is similar to use case package "P300").

####Overview Use Case Packages
In order to ensure a better overview use cases are organized in 9 main use case packages reflecting the 9 system processes. The following schema shows the use case model of Sulu 2.0:
